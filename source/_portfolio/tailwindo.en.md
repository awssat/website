## Overview

Tailwindo is a conversion tool that transforms Bootstrap CSS classes into Tailwind CSS equivalents across HTML/PHP files. With over **1,100 stars** on GitHub, it's become an essential tool for developers migrating from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Conversion**: Converts Bootstrap classes to Tailwind CSS in single files, code snippets, or entire folders
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for adding support for additional CSS frameworks beyond Bootstrap
- **CSS Extraction**: Can extract converted styles as separate CSS files using Tailwind's `@apply` directive
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains original class names for smooth migration
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tool with Packagist distribution

## Problem Solved

Migrating from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS traditionally requires manually rewriting classes throughout the entire codebase. Tailwindo streamlines this process by automatically refactoring stylesheets, saving developers countless hours of tedious work.

## Impact
